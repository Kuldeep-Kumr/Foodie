# Foodie

Welcome to the README for Foodies App!

This repository contains a secure API developed using Django Rest Framework and consumed with Angular. It's designed to provide a robust backend system along with a sleek frontend interface.

## Features

### User and Owner Authentication

Authentication mechanisms are implemented using Django Rest Token for both users and owners. This ensures secure access to the system by requiring authentication tokens for accessing protected resources. Users and owners can authenticate themselves using tokens generated by the server, providing a secure way to interact with the application.

### Data Serialization

Django's powerful serializers are utilized to efficiently manage data serialization. Serialization is the process of converting complex data types into a format that can be easily transmitted over a network or stored in a database. With Django serializers, data objects are converted into JSON format, enabling seamless communication between the frontend and backend components of the application.

### Admin Panel

The integration of Django's admin panel offers an intuitive interface for administrators to manage various aspects of the application effortlessly. Administrators can access the admin panel through a web browser to perform tasks such as adding or editing users, managing database records, viewing system logs, and performing other administrative functions. This provides a convenient way to manage the application without writing custom admin interfaces.

### API Versioning

API versioning strategies are adopted to effectively manage changes and updates to the API. Versioning allows developers to introduce new features or modifications to existing endpoints without breaking backward compatibility with existing client applications. By versioning the API, developers can ensure that changes are rolled out smoothly, minimizing disruptions to users and maintaining compatibility with older client versions.

### Optimized Database Queries

Database queries are optimized for performance, enhancing the overall responsiveness and scalability of the system. Optimization techniques such as indexing, query optimization, and caching are employed to improve query execution time and reduce database load. By optimizing database queries, the application can handle large volumes of data and concurrent user requests more efficiently, resulting in faster response times and improved user experience.

### Dependency Management

Pipenv is used for dependency management, facilitating easy installation and maintenance of project dependencies. Pipenv is a package management tool that automatically creates and manages virtual environments for Python projects, ensuring that dependencies are isolated and reproducible across different environments. By using Pipenv, developers can easily install, upgrade, and remove dependencies, streamlining the development process and improving project maintainability.

### ViewSets

ViewSets are employed for better API structure and organization, streamlining the development process and improving code readability. ViewSets allow developers to group related API endpoints together, reducing code duplication and making it easier to manage and maintain the API. With ViewSets, developers can define a set of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for a particular data model, reducing the amount of boilerplate code required to implement API endpoints.

### Restaurant Menu Management

Restaurant owners have the ability to add, update, or remove dishes from their menu. They can access a dashboard where they can manage their menu items, including setting prices, descriptions. Additionally, owners can change the status of orders placed by users, updating them as they are prepared and delivered.

### User Order Placement

Users can browse menus of restaurants, view details about dishes, and place orders for delivery or pickup. They can place their order. Users can also track the status of their orders in real-time, receiving updates as their orders are prepared and delivered.

### Review and Rating System

Users can leave reviews and ratings for dishes and restaurants they have ordered from. They can provide feedback on the quality of the food, service, and overall dining experience. Additionally, users can view the average ratings of dishes and restaurants, helping them make informed decisions when placing orders. Restaurant owners have the ability to view the user reviews.
